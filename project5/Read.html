            <p>This gel (although more like a serum) is a soothing, moisturizing gel that hydrates skin and relieves it of redness and sensitivity.<br>
                I have seen a huge difference in my skin with this product as it has calmed the redness and inflammation in blemishes, yet keeps <br>
                my skin hydrated. This is definitely one of my favorite products on the market!</p>

            <p>This product has changed the game for me when it comes to a cleanser. I have always struggled with acne and this facial cleanser<br> 
                effectively prevents acne and clears blocked pores. It is lightweight and gentle on the skin keeping my face hydrated <br>
                and clean without dehydrating it!</p>

            <img src="../project-images/2023__Madover_I-1035526cerave.jpg" height="150px" alt="CeraVe Moisturizing Cream">
            <p>One of the best moisturizers out there! Simple and effective, the CeraVe moisturizing cream is a rich, non-greasy, fast-absorbing<br>
                moisturizer that keeps my face hydrated. I love this moisturizer because it is an inexpensive, drugstore find that actually works!</p>

            <img src="../project-images/2023__Madover_I-1035513dae.jpg" height="150px" alt="dae Cactus Fruit 3-IN-1 Styling Cream"> 
            <p>Who doesn’t love a 3-IN-1 product? The dae Cactus Fruit 3-IN-1 styling cream preps blowouts, defines curls, and smooths styles. <br>
                Not to mention smells amazing! I am a recent user of this product and I absolutely love it because it doesn’t leave my hair <br>
                feeling sticky or crunchy as many hair products do. I use the styling cream for my slick back hairstyles and they have never looked better!</p>
