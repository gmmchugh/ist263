        <p>
            My name is Grace McHugh and I am an Information Management & Technology major concentrating in Digital Retail Strategies interested in e-commerce. This past summer I worked as an <strong>SEO Intern</strong> for a Tech Ad Agency. I was introduced to many skills used in SEO such as tech audits, video optimization, Google My Business, and Google Analytics to name a few. This internship gave me the opportunity to apply skills I have learned in the classroom and use them in a professional setting. I like to read on the beach and my favorite book at the moment is “Seven Days in the Art World”. I have 3 older siblings and am a new Aunt to a beautiful baby girl! A habit I have is only drinking half of my coffee and I absolutely despise fluorescent lighting which is why I never turn the lights on in my room. I love visiting and reading about Contemporary Art and hope to end up in the Art Industry when I am older.
